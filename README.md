# My first Vue.js project <img src="https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png" width="120" height="120">
I decided to create this repository for someone that may want to learn a little about VUE.JS.
The project contains a paginated news feed called from a json file with a search function.

## Build Setup


# clone
git clone `git clone https://github.com/nytegoth1/udacity_book_project.git`

# install vue
npm install -g vue-cli

# install dependencies
npm install

# install Axios
npm install axios --save

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
